            Product</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                <b>Product</b> and <b>Process</b> are the two crucial terms in software development. The elementary
                difference between
                the
                two is that a "process" is a sequence of steps to be followed to create an appropriate product, while a
                "product" is the final outcome of the software development cycle.
            </p>
            <h4>What is product?</h4>
            <p>The <b>product</b> is the final outcome of the software development process. It is the software
                application
                or system that is being built or maintained. A product is built on the customer's
                requirements/requests.

                In the context of software development, a product consists of several components such as requirement
                specifications, design and test documents, user manuals, etc. To develop a desired software product,
                the software development team and the customer should define the purpose and scope of the product.
                The "purpose" gives the information about the objective of the product, and the "scope" gives the
                details about fundamental data, functions, and behavior of the product.</p>
            <h4>What is process?</h4>
            <p>The <b>process</b> is a set of steps that are to be followed to create a software product. A
                process is
                basically a template that can be used to create multiple products in a similar fashion. In
                software development, the process directs the development of the product. The process takes care
                of all the development cycles of a software product.

                Process makes the progressive changes in requirements of the product. It includes the various
                stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), such as planning, analysis, design,
                implementation, testing, and deployment. The process also includes the methods, techniques, and
                tools that are used to complete the work, such as agile methodologies, version control systems,
                and integrated development environments (IDEs).

                The main objective of the process in software development is to ensure the successful completion
                of each phase of the software development.</p>
