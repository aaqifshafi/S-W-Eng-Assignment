        <h1 class="text-center" id="heading">Software Characteristics</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>An engineer’s first consideration when creating any kind of software product is, “What are the
                characteristics of a good software product?” Well before we talk about Software characteristics, let’s
                look at what one can reasonably expect from any software.
            <ul>
                <li>First and foremost, a software product must satisfy the needs of the end-user as well as the
                    business.</li>
                <li>Additionally, software development and maintenance should be affordable.</li>
                <li>Software development should be completed within the specified time frame.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Top Characteristics of Software</h4>
            <p>The quality of a software product is determined by what it offers and how easily it can be used. Software
                is judged by different people on different grounds. Customers, for instance, want software that meets
                their specific needs. Similarly, developers engaged in designing, coding, and maintaining the software
                determine the quality of the software by assessing its internal characteristics. Let’s check them out…
            </p>
            <h4>Functionality</h4>
            <p>The functionality of software refers to its ability to perform and function according to design
                specification. In simple terms, software systems should function correctly, i.e. perform all the
                functions for which they are designed.<br>

                The functions refer to the features that the end user as well as the business expect as basic facilities
                from the system. All these functions must be integrated into the system. Many software applications out
                there are designed for simplicity, but ultimately, the purpose of software is to provide its users with
                the desired functionality. In order to look like the best software product, it must have a clear
                appearance, components, and functions. However, there are also those products out there that can provide
                a great deal of value for your money. </p>
            <h4>Usability (User-friendly)
            </h4>
            <p>The user-friendliness of the software is characterized by its ease of use. In other words, learning how
                to use the software should require less effort or time. Navigating the software is extremely important
                since it helps determine the journey the user takes within the software. This is imperative to ensuring
                visitors remain on your website and have a positive experience, which leads to an increase in sales and
                brand loyalty. </p>
            <h4>Efficiency</h4>
            <p>Essentially, it refers to the software’s ability to utilize human and system resources such as time,
                effort, CPU, memory, computation power, network bandwidth, files, databases, etc., as effectively and
                efficiently as possible. For a software project to succeed, efficiency is crucial. In addition to
                meeting the needs for which the software was made, it must also provide excellent features designed to
                assist users in completing their tasks faster. Software should make efficient use of storage space and
                execute commands according to timing requirements.<br>

                In order to be efficient, a software must offer users proper value in terms of their time and cash. The
                market is filled with products that cater to various industries, but only a handful of products are
                efficient enough to benefit individuals and businesses. The medical billing software that Open Practice
                Solutions provides, for instance, makes billing processes much more efficient for clients than those
                offered by other companies.

            </p>
            <h4>Flexibility </h4>
            <p>Software Flexibility refers to the ability of the software solution to adapt to potential or future
                changes in its requirements. When evaluating the flexibility of software, look at how simple it is to
                add, modify, or remove features without interfering with the current operation.<br>It is essential to
                keep
                up with rapidly changing markets, technologies, and customer needs. In software development, change is
                inevitable; it can arise during the development process itself or as the result of future requirements.
                Flexibility is therefore highly valued. Consequently, any software product must be scalable, flexible,
                and easily adaptable to future technology. When designing or building a software product, be sure to
                plan for these changes that are inevitably going to occur. Loose coupling of components is the key to
                creating highly flexible systems.</p>
            <h4>Reliability</h4>
            <p>The reliability of a software product describes the likelihood it will operate without failure over a
                specified period of time under certain conditions. It determines the ability of software to maintain its
                level of performance (provide desired functionality) under specified conditions for a specified period
                of time. Generally speaking, software reliability is measured as the availability of the software. The
                value should not be less than 99%. In reliability testing, the goal is not perfection, but achieving a
                level of reliability that is acceptable before a software product is released to customers. MTTF, MTTR,
                MTBR, etc., are some reliability metrics that can be used to quantify the reliability of a software
                product.</p>
            <h4>Maintainability</h4>
            <p>Maintainability refers to how easily you can repair, improve and comprehend software code. In some ways,
                maintaining is similar to being flexible. Maintainability deals with the modification of errors and
                minor alterations to software code, while flexibility focuses on major functional extensions. It also
                involves maintaining the services and functionality of the software.<br>
                Most of the time, developers are not the ones who maintain the software. Therefore, good documentation
                is crucial, which includes code documentation, interface definitions, etc. Maintainability of software
                products is affected by the quality of the documentation. Typically, more than half of development
                budgets are spent on software maintenance. Maintenance should therefore be integrated into the
                development lifecycle for effective software maintenance.</p>
            <h4>Portability</h4>
            <p>Software portability is a critical factor that cannot be ignored. Portability refers to the ability to
                use software in different environments. This is the ease with which software can be ported from one
                platform to another without (or with minimal) changes, while obtaining similar results. As simple as it
                may sound, it refers to the ability of software to work on different hardware platforms without any (or
                little) modifications needed.<br>
                Furthermore, you should be aware that porting software to a new environment is comparatively cheaper
                than developing an equivalent application from scratch. There can be no doubt that portability is a
                crucial aspect of reducing development costs.
            </p>
            <h4>Integrity</h4>
            <p>There are multiple interpretations of software integrity. Some people tend to associate integrity with
                security, believing it is resistant to hacks and privacy violations. To others, high integrity means
                that the software cannot be modified without authorization.Integrity is key for demonstrating the
                safety, security, and maintainability of your software. In addition, software that needs to be compliant
                with industry regulations and coding standards requires high code integrity. Achieving software
                integrity can be difficult. Yet, with the right practices to improve safety, security, and
                maintainability, the challenge can be easily overcome. In these days of increased security threats, all
                software must include this factor.
